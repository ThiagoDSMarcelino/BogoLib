## Introduction
This library has the goal of implements several bogo algorithms, this way will be easier to compare the inefficiency of these algorithmsÂ in relation to others.

## What's a valid Bogo Algorithm?
A valid bogo algorithm needs to be checked without any other complicated algorithm, for example:

Square root is a valid algorithm, because we just need to multiply the result by itself, and then we will know if it's the right result

Factorial isn't a valid algorithm, because we will need to write a conventional factorial algorithm to check if the result it's right
