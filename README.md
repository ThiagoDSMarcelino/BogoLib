## Introduction
This library aims to implement various Bogo algorithms, making it easier to compare their inefficiencies with other algorithms.

## What's a valid Bogo Algorithm?
A valid Bogo algorithm should be verifiable without employing any other complex algorithm. 

For example:

* Square root is a valid algorithm since we only need to multiply the result by itself to verify its correctness.

* Factorial isn't a valid algorithm because we would need to implement a conventional factorial algorithm to verify its correctness.
